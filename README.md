# GoPerceptron
```
GoPerceptron is effectively a single neuron that can make binary decisions in classifying data. This data must be linearly separable to correctly classify data. It can make decisions on multi-dimensional data and can mimic the decision-making process of AND, NAND, and OR gates with ease. It cannot be trained on linearly-inseparable data, that is, n-dimensional data that cannot be separated by an (n-1)-dimensional object. In two dimensions, this is equivalent to being able to separate classes by a single line.
